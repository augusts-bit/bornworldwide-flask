# bornworldwide-flask
Web application with Leaflet in which you spawn to a random country based on the odds of being born there. Based on: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_births> (I actually used one that was based on 2020-2025 projections but I cannot find it anymore). Build with Python Flask.

Up and running on <https://bornworldwide.pythonanywhere.com>.
